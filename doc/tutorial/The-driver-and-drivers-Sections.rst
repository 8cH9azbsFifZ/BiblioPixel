The ``driver`` and ``drivers`` Sections
===================================================

The ``driver`` and ``drivers`` section define the hardware or virtual outputs
that actually display your lighting pattern.

If there is only a single output, you can use just the ``driver`` Section, but
if there us more than one output, then you must use the ``drivers`` Section.

The ``driver`` Section
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``driver`` Section is a Class Section, and therefore the Fields depend on
the specific type of Driver.

We have the following driver classes: [TODO-API: link to the autogenerated docs
here]


* ``artnet``
* ``curses``
* ``dummy``
* ``gif_writer``
* ``hue``
* ``mirror``
* ``network``
* ``simpixel``
* ``text``
* ``PiWS281X``

There is also the Serial Driver, which handles most of the different LED strips,
and is the subject of the next document.

**Example 1**\ : A ``driver`` Section for a serial device

.. code-block:: yaml

   driver:
     c_order: BRG
     gamma: [1.1, 0.5, 0]
     ledtype: LPD8806
     typename: serial
     device_id: 1

The ``drivers`` Section
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This is an advanced section and may be skipped on first reading.

The ``drivers`` is a list of Class Sections and is used when there are multiple
Drivers in one project.

If there is both a ``driver`` and ``drivers`` section, then the ``driver`` Class
Section is used as a template for each entry in the ``drivers`` section.  This
often removes a huge amount of duplicated typing:

**Example 2**\ : A ``drivers`` Section for three serial devices

.. code-block:: yaml

   drivers:
     - c_order: BRG
       num: 80
       gamma: [1.1, 0.5, 0]
       ledtype: LPD8806
       typename: serial
       device_id: 1

     - c_order: BRG
       num: 100
       gamma: [1.1, 0.5, 0]
       ledtype: LPD8806
       typename: serial
       device_id: 3

     - c_order: BRG
       num: 80
       gamma: [1.1, 0.5, 0]
       ledtype: LPD8806
       typename: serial
       device_id: 0

**Example 3**\ : Same as before, with ``driver`` and ``drivers`` Sections

.. code-block:: yaml

   driver:
     c_order: BRG
     gamma: [1.1, 0.5, 0]
     ledtype: LPD8806
     typename: serial
     num: 80

   drivers:
    - device_id: 1
    - device_id: 3
      num: 100
    - device_id: 0
